				<h1> FAQs </h1>
					<span>Are there auditions?</span>
					<br/>There are no auditions for most of our groups. Membership for the competitive Mini Corps is determined throughout the year based on seniority and part coverage.
					<br/><br/><span>Are there dues?</span>
					<br/>There are NO dues for any of our groups. Additionally, travel costs (including hotels and coach buses) are frequently covered by the organization.
					<br/><br/><span>What if I play the trombone/French horn/didgeridoo?</span>
					<br/>It depends. Our Holiday and Patriotic groups have almost no limitations on instrumentation, as long as it's in the brass family. However, there are some DCA requirements for our Mini and Concert Corps groups.
					<br/><br/><span>Do I have to memorize music?</span>
					<br/>Only the Mini Corps memorizes music; all other groups in Brig Juice allow stands.
					<br/><br/><span>Do I have to march?</span>
					<br/>Only the Mini Corps has light movement; all other groups in Brig Juice are stand still.
					<br/><br/><span>Can I still join even if I've never played in a marching band or drum corps?</span>
					<br/>Of course! We do not require any marching experience. However, there are some easy commands (such as "Horns Up" or "Parade Rest") that you will have to learn.
					<br/><br/><span>What if I haven't played in 10 (or 20 or 30) years?</span>
					<br/>Many of our members have returned to playing after not touching their horn for decades. Although the first few months can be tough, most find that their chops return to normal after some time (and a lot of lip slurs).
					<br/><br/><span>What if I don't have an instrument?</span>
					<br/>If you would like to join but don't have an instrument, please contact us and one may be provided for you.
					<br/><br/><span>Where and when do you rehearse?</span>
					<br/>We rehearse at <a href ="https://goo.gl/maps/1s1G9Gq2xnycwemN7" target="_blank">St Agustine's church in Baldwinsville </a> on Sundays from 1:30 to 4:30, although this can vary. An email is sent out each week to confirm the time and location. If you'd like to sit in on a rehearsal before deciding to join, please contact us at <address><a href="mailto:BrigJuice@gmail.com">BrigJuice@gmail.com</a></address>.
					<br/><br/><span>Do I have to practice at home in addition to rehearsals?</span>
					<br/>Yes.
