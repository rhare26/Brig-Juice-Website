				<br/><h2> What Groups Make Up Brig Juice?</h2>
					<p>
						The Brig Juice organization is loosely divided into many smaller groups and seasons. Most Brig Juice members participate in multiple groups depending on their availability. There are NO dues for any group.
						<ul>
							<li><span>The Brass Concert Corps </span> plays non-competitively at <a href ="https://www.syracuse.com/entertainment/2019/06/jazz-fest-alive-and-well-in-syracuse.html" target="_blank" > music festivals</a>, drum corps shows, and other events. This is one of our larger groups and plays somewhat challenging music, with a lot of Latin and jazz. Music stands are allowed. </li>
							<li><span>The Mini Corps </span> is a competitive ensemble that performs annually at the DCA Mini Corps Finals. This is a select group of 25 musicians that plays more demanding music, often memorized and with some movement. Past shows have included music from Westside Story, Chick Corea, and Maynard Ferguson. </li>
							<li><span>The Holiday Brass Concert Corps </span> performs holiday music at <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/BrigJuice/videos/1798516263608535/?__so__=permalink&__rv__=related_videos" target="_blank" >mall concerts</a>, tree lightings, nursing homes, and winter festivals through November and December. This is a fun group that plays both traditional and jazzed-up versions of Christmas carols.</li>
							<li><span>The Patriotic Brass Corps </span> performs at Veteran's Day ceremonies, Memorial Day parades, and the <a href ="https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/ultimate-brasstacular-supports-honor-flight/" target="_blank" > annual Brasstacular Honor Flight fundraiser in Greece, NY.</a> This group is open to all levels and plays mostly traditional patriotic music. </li>
							<li><span>The Brigadiers Reunion Corps </span> was formed in honor of the Brigadiers 65th anniversary and performed at the 2019 DCA Alumni Spectacular in Williamsport, PA. Several former Brigadiers members flew in across the country to perform. Although the 2020 DCA season has been cancelled, there are plans to make this reunion an annual tradition in the future. </li>
